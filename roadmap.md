# AI-Driven Virtual Career Mentor for Students Roadmap

## Overview
The AI-Driven Virtual Career Mentor is designed to assist students with personalized career guidance through:
- **Job Recommendations:** Matching student skills and interests with available job roles using a static dataset and AI-driven matching algorithms.
- **Resume Analysis:** Using NLP to parse resumes and provide keyword-based improvement suggestions.
- **Mock Interview Simulations:** Offering preset interview questions with AI-driven feedback for improvement.

## Objectives
- Provide a fast, user-friendly tool for career guidance.
- Leverage AI and NLP to enhance the student’s career development process.
- Create a scalable prototype (web or mobile) that can be demoed quickly.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (Web) or Flutter (Mobile)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) or Django (Python)
- **Database:** Firebase, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB (for storing user profiles, job roles, etc.)
- **AI/NLP:** Python libraries (NLTK, spaCy) and pre-trained models or lightweight APIs for NLP tasks.
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth or Auth0

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Planning & Requirements Gathering
- **Define User Personas:** Identify target students and their needs.
- **Feature Breakdown:** List all features (authentication, job recommendations, resume analysis, interview simulations).
- **Dataset Preparation:** Curate a static dataset of job roles and market trends (can be a CSV or JSON file).
- **Tools and Libraries:** Finalize technology choices and necessary libraries/APIs.

**Prompts & Actions:**
- “List the core functionalities for the career mentor.”
- “Research available job role datasets for static use.”
- “Decide on the authentication method for users.”

### Phase 2: Authentication & User Interface
- **User Authentication:** Implement signup/login with Firebase/Auth0.
- **Profile Management:** Create pages for users to input skills, interests, and upload resumes.
- **UI/UX Design:** Develop wireframes and prototypes (use tools like Figma).

**Prompts & Actions:**
- “Design a user-friendly dashboard for career recommendations.”
- “Prototype the resume upload and skills input forms.”

### Phase 3: Job Recommendation System
- **Data Processing:** Create functions to parse the static dataset.
- **Matching Algorithm:** Implement a basic matching algorithm (e.g., using cosine similarity or TF-IDF).
- **Display Recommendations:** Build UI components to show job roles and related data.

**Prompts & Actions:**
- “Implement a function to compute similarity between user skills and job role requirements.”
- “Display top 5 matching jobs on the dashboard.”

### Phase 4: Resume Analysis Module
- **NLP Parsing:** Use NLP libraries to extract key resume sections (skills, education, experience).
- **Keyword Suggestions:** Compare parsed data against job role keywords and suggest improvements.
- **Feedback Interface:** Create a module to display actionable suggestions.

**Prompts & Actions:**
- “Develop an NLP pipeline to extract and analyze resume content.”
- “Identify missing keywords from resumes and display suggestions.”

### Phase 5: Mock Interview Simulation
- **Question Bank:** Develop a preset bank of interview questions categorized by industry.
- **AI Feedback:** Use simple rules or AI to rate and provide feedback on user responses.
- **Interactive Simulation:** Build a chat-like interface for simulating interviews.

**Prompts & Actions:**
- “Design a function to randomly select interview questions.”
- “Provide immediate feedback based on preset criteria after each answer.”

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing
- **API Development:** Build REST APIs for user data, resume analysis, job recommendations, and interview simulations.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Unit and integration testing of individual modules.
- **User Testing:** Gather feedback from sample users to refine UI/UX.

**Prompts & Actions:**
- “Write unit tests for the job matching algorithm.”
- “Collect user feedback on the interview simulation feature.”

### Phase 7: Deployment & Demo
- **Hosting:** Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, Firebase Hosting).
- **Demo Preparation:** Create a short demo video or presentation highlighting user flow and technical implementation.
- **Documentation:** Finalize documentation for users and developers (including this roadmap).

**Prompts & Actions:**
- “Set up CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.”
- “Prepare a demo script that walks through all key features.”

## Useful Data & Resources
- **Datasets:** Use public job role datasets available on Kaggle or static CSVs from job boards.
- **NLP Libraries:** [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
- **AI Models:** Consider lightweight models for quick prototyping; use pre-trained embeddings.
- **Design Tools:** [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for wireframes and UI prototypes.
- **Development Resources:** GitHub repositories for similar career guidance projects (e.g., [DevOps Roadmap](&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}) for inspiration on roadmap design).

## Timeline & Milestones
- **Week 1-2:** Planning, dataset collection, technology stack finalization.
- **Week 3-4:** Develop authentication, basic UI, and profile management.
- **Week 5-6:** Implement job recommendation engine and resume analysis module.
- **Week 7:** Build mock interview simulation and integrate modules.
- **Week 8:** Testing, user feedback, bug fixing.
- **Week 9:** Deployment, demo video creation, final documentation.

## Final Deliverables
- A fully functional prototype (web or mobile app).
- A demo presentation video showcasing the application workflow.
- Complete documentation including this roadmap.
